        aboutArtist: "De Heem was born in Utrecht as Johannes van Antwerpen. He studied first under his father David de Heem the Elder (1570~1631), then under Balthasar van der Ast. He lived in Leiden from about 1625 to 1629, where he studied in 1629 under David Bailly (1584- c. 1657).@His still lifes included fruit pieces, vanitas still lifes and flower pieces, but he is best known for his ornate or sumptuous still lifes, the so-called 'pronkstillevens'. Some of his works are displays of abundance; others, only a festoon or a nosegay.",
        aboutPainting: "The Dutch still-life paintings of the seventeenth century perfectly capture the idea of Ars longa, vie brevis (art is long, life is short) as do Jan Davidsz de Heem's paintings of flowers, which celebrate the beauty of nature.@De Heem's artwork also represented the era's intense interest in botany, and this piece features exotic flowers and plants that were brought back from distant lands, such the tulip, which was first brought to Europe from Turkey in the 1550s.@De Heem frequently incorporated particular animals and flowers because of their underlying symbolic connotations. While a snail, a moth, and several ants crawl on the marble shelf, a salamander stares hungrily at a spider, symbolising darkness and rot. ",
