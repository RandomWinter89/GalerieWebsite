        biography: `Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606 - c. 1683/1684) was a Dutch painter, renowned for his exquisite still-life compositions. Born in Utrecht, he was baptized on April 17, 1606. He initially trained under Balthasar van der Ast, a prominent still-life painter. Around 1625, de Heem moved to Leiden, where he refined his technique and joined the Guild of St. Luke.@By 1636, he relocated to Antwerp, where he became a citizen and joined the local Guild of St. Luke in 1637. His work blended Dutch precision with Flemish Baroque richness, particularly in flower and banquet still lifes. He often depicted extravagant displays of fruit, flowers, and luxury items, meticulously rendered with symbolic references to wealth, mortality, and the passage of time.@De Heem's style evolved over the decades, influencing a generation of still-life painters, including his son Cornelis de Heem and artists such as Abraham Mignon. He likely returned to the Dutch Republic in the 1660s due to political turmoil but continued to work between Utrecht and Antwerp. His precise death date remains uncertain, but he is believed to have passed away in Antwerp around 1683 or 1684.@His works are housed in major collections, including the Rijksmuseum, Louvre, and National Gallery.`,
